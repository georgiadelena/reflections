What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A .git file is made. This is how you can make commits and track them.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The working directory is the directory you're working on, where your files are located. The staging area is an intermediate area where you can add files one at a time. When you're ready to commit, Git bundles the entire contents of the staging area into a single commit and adds that to the repository.
