When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

For storage purposes, and collaborating with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because I might want to have a different version on my computer and I'd like to choose myself whether I would update it or not.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

You can fork  someone's repository on GitHub, which means that you get your own copy on your GitHub profile. Then, you can either edit it from there, or clone it to your computer, so that you can have your own version. Cloning means getting a copy on your computer from GitHub. Branches have to do with different versions within your repository (regarding commits).

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

Avoiding conflicts when pulling.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

It would be hard to track the history of changes with files being sent here and there to each collaborator. Merging files would be crazy. However, you have to know the exact commands to use Git/GitHub.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

When you're trying a new version that needs to be approved first. Working in master is more straightforward, but with a separate branch you can do a pull request and collaborate more efficiently.
