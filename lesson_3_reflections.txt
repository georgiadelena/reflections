When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

For storage purposes, and collaborating with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because I might want to have a different version on my computer and I'd like to choose myself whether I would update it or not.
